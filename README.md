## DEV SETUP

The project has following major dependencies:

-   PHP 8.2
-   Laravel 10.x
-   Vue 2.7
-   Node v18.8
-   npm 8.18

After pulling the project from the repository run `composer install` and `npm install`. That will setup all the necessary JS and PHP packages. For a detailed list of available npm scripts, check the package.json file.

.env.example file in the root directory of the projects needs to be copied (in the same folder .env.example is located in) and renamed .env

Make sure to fill out the .env file with the correct database credentials and other relevant information (depending on the host setup).

A blank mysql database to import and use is available in the following directory: /database/migrations/whitelabel.sql

You can generate an app key using `php artisan key:generate` command. Make sure to use the same key across all 3 applications (pharmacist, pharmacist-inventory, pharmacist-shipping).

## PRODUCTION SETUP

Only Composer is required to setup the project on a production server. After pulling the project from the repository it is necessary to run `composer install` and rename .env.example file as specified in the DEV SETUP. .env file might need to be adjusted to a different database setup depending on the project. Following that, the project should be up and running.

Make sure to run `npm run production` beforehand to generate the production ready JS and CSS files.

## PASSPORT

This will set up the passport keys for the application (if API functionality is needed)

```
php artisan passport:install
//create links in /storage/app
ln -s /home/sites/mwoldek/natcol/dev/xml/dev/error xml_error
ln -s /home/sites/mwoldek/natcol/dev/tml/docs pdf
ln -s /home/sites/mwoldek/natcol/xml xml
```
